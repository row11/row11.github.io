I am a Fulbright Postdoctoral Fellow at Tel Aviv University, working with [Niv Buchbinder](https://www.tau.ac.il/~nivb/). I just received my PhD in [Algorithms, Combinatorics and Optimization (ACO)]("http://aco.math.cmu.edu/") from Carnegie Mellon University, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Anupam Gupta]("http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~anupamg/"). I am broadly interested in theoretical computer science, more specifically in approximation algorithms for uncertain environments (e.g. online/dynamic/streaming models). I also like pretty much anything involving submodular functions.

Previously I worked at the [Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence](http://allenai.org/) from 2015 to 2017. I was a research engineer on the Euclid team.

Before that I received a B.Sc. in Computer Science/Applied Mathematics, and a B.Sc. in Mathematics from Brown University, class of 2015.
